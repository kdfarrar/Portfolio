		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<img src="_assets/Headshot.jpg" alt="Picture of Me"/>

		<p>Technology has been a major part of my life from a young age. For me it has been a creative outlet, a way to socialize and connect with others, and a source of learning. Over the years, I've dabbled in many areas of IT to get a feel for what I did and didn't enjoy. Each taught me something valuable that I still use today.</p>

		<p>My first exposure to coding was through HTML and CSS during a time when websites like MySpace and Tumblr were buzzing with activity and everyone had a customized page.</p>

		<p>It wasn't until middle school that I got my first real oppurtunity to branch out and try new things. It was during those years that I learned how to type, edit my first video, create my first website from scratch, and make photobashes in GIMP. My instructor at the time was the one who made me start considering a career in IT.</p>

		<p>Later on in high school, I took classes in graphic design, 3D modeling, and programming. I took any and every class that interested me. Each posed their own unique challenges that forced me to adapt my way of thinking while learning new skills. I found myself using these skills in other classes and in my own personal projects and creative pursuits. By that point, I was certain in my career path and knew that it was the right one for me.<p>

		<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
		<p>I've been writing since I was very young. I think part of what got me into it was my love of reading. I've always wanted to tell beautiful stories like my favorite authors.</p>

		<p>In addition to reading and writing, I also play a lot of video games. Video games were a sort of gateway into technology for me. That hobby has stayed with me throughout the years and to this day I still use games as a way to spend time with others. Getting to take programming classes in high school was especially exciting because I got to finally peak behind the curtain and see into the process of how these things were created.</p>
